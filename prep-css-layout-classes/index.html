          Hiccup (Donald Reignoux) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons are a way of life. His
          progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Emmanuel Jacomy) is
          chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking. When he befriends
          an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

          Five years have passed since Hiccup and Toothless united the dragons and Vikings of Berk. Now, they spend their time
          charting the island's unmapped territories. During one of their adventures, the pair discover a secret cave that houses
          hundreds of wild dragons -- and a mysterious dragon rider who turns out to be Hiccup's long-lost mother, Valka (Cate
          Blanchett). Hiccup and Toothless then find themselves at the center of a battle to protect Berk from a power-hungry
          warrior named Drago.

          All seems well on the island of Berk as Vikings and dragons live together in peace and harmony. Now a Viking leader,
          Hiccup finds himself increasingly attracted to Astrid, while his beloved dragon Toothless meets an enchanting creature
          who captures his eye. When the evil Grimmel launches a devious plan to wipe out all the dragons, Hiccup must unite both
          clans to find Caldera, a hidden land that holds the key to saving Toothless and his flying friends.
